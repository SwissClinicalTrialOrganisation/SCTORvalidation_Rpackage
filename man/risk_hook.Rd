\title{Hook for collecting user-defined chunk risk level in markdown documents}
\usage{
risk_hook(options, before)
}
\arguments{
\item{options}{chunk options}

\item{before}{whether the hook is called before or after the chunk (only
before does anything)}
}
\description{
This is a function that can be used with Rmarkdown or quarto to collect the
risk associated with a particular chunk. The risk level can then be tabulated
towards the end of the document to give an overview of the risk associated
with the product.
}
\examples{
# in e.g. setup chunk
knitr::knit_hooks$set(risk = SCTORvalidation::risk_hook)
RISKENV <- new.env()

# as a chunk option
#```{r highriskchunk, echo=FALSE, risk = "high"}
#```{r mediumriskchunk, echo=FALSE, risk = "medium"}
#```{r lowriskchunk, echo=FALSE, risk = "low"}

# towards the end of the script, tabulate RISKENV$chunk_risk for an overview
}
